# Python for Security

Simple cybersecurity-focused Python scripts I've created or adapted for security tasks.

## Projects
- `log_parser.py` — Parse login records and highlight failures
- `port_scanner.py` — Basic TCP port scanner
- `hash_checker.py` — Compare file hashes to verify integrity

## Sample Usage
- Detect unusual login behavior
- Scan machines during incident response
- Validate patch installations via checksum
